# Phase Terminale / Soul Hunter

Multiplayer game, Top down 3 players controllers required ! (you can play with fewer players by pressing the "Space" key during the "Controller Attribution" / "Press Start" scene)

## SYNOPSIS :
Phase Terminale is a 3 players game, Top down game. (Controllers required ! You can play with less than 3 players by pressing the "Space" key during the "Controller Attribution" / "Press Start" scene)? Developped during the GDPJam#14 in two days with mostly Unity newcomers.

Players control characters from "La petite mort" (french dark humoristic comic by Davy Mourier). They'll have to pass their "fauche imaginaire" exam, to do so they'll have to reap leukemic kids's souls and bring them back to their respective base. (Don't worry it's taking place in a virtual world, we're not monsters :3). Players can take souls by building their "death sphere" and releasing it. Doing so will kill every human within it and release their souls (represented by brown spheres). The first player to reach 10 souls win. 

## CONTROLS :
Left Stick -> Move the player

L1 / Lb -> Build up "Death sphere"

R1 / Rb -> Dash (allow player to go through walls)
